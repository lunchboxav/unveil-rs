# Transition animations

Unveil comes with a set of custom CSS properties. 

For example you can add a transition to your slide by adding the following to the
stylematter : 

```

--on-enter-animation: zoom-in
+++

# I will Zoom in on enter !
```

Refer to unveil's [README](https://github.com/oknozor/unveil-rs#custom-css-properties) to get the full list of available transitions.
